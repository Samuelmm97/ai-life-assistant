# ADK Agent Execution Pattern Update

## Overview

Updated all ADK agents to follow the recommended execution pattern for better event handling, error management, and debugging visibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ADK Steering Documentation (`.kiro/steering/ADK Usage.md`)

- Replaced the basic agent execution example with the recommended pattern
- Added proper event iteration with `is_final_response()` detection
- Included error handling for escalations and edge cases
- Added logging with `>>> User Query:` and `<<< Agent Response:` format

### 2. Updated ADK Configuration (`python-agents/adk_config.py`)

**Before:**
```python
async def execute_agent(self, agent: Agent, user_input: str, user_id: str = "default_user", session_id: str = None) -> str:
    # Simple event iteration without proper logging or error handling
    async for event in runner.run_async(...):
        if event.is_final_response():
            if event.content and event.content.parts:
                return event.content.parts[0].text
    return "No response generated"
```

**After:**
```python
async def execute_agent_async(self, agent: Agent, user_input: str, user_id: str = "default_user", session_id: str = None) -> str:
    print(f"\n>>> User Query: {user_input}")
    
    # Prepare the user's message in ADK format
    content = types.Content(role='user', parts=[types.Part(text=user_input)])
    
    final_response_text = "Agent did not produce a final response."  # Default
    
    # Key Concept: run_async executes the agent logic and yields Events.
    # We iterate through events to find the final answer.
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id, new_message=content):
        # Key Concept: is_final_response() marks the concluding message for the turn.
        if event.is_final_response():
            if event.content and event.content.parts:
                # Assuming text response in the first part
                final_response_text = event.content.parts[0].text
            elif event.actions and event.actions.escalate:  # Handle potential errors/escalations
                final_response_text = f"Agent escalated: {event.error_message or 'No specific message.'}"
            # Add more checks here if needed (e.g., specific error codes)
            break  # Stop processing events once the final response is found
    
    print(f"<<< Agent Response: {final_response_text}")
    return final_response_text
```

### 3. Agent Integration

All existing agents automatically benefit from the new pattern because they use the centralized `adk_config.execute_agent_sync()` method:

- **GoalPlanningAgent**: Creates SMART goals from natural language
- **SMARTCriteriaAgent**: Generates specific criteria suggestions  
- **GoalAnalysisAgent**: Analyzes goals for SMART compliance
- **MasterOrchestratorAgent**: Coordinates multi-agent workflows

### 4. Test and Demo Scripts

Created verification scripts to test the new pattern:

- `test_updated_agents.py`: Tests all agents with the new execution pattern
- `demo_new_pattern.py`: Demonstrates the improved event handling and logging

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Visibility
- Clear logging with `>>> User Query:` and `<<< Agent Response:` format
- Easier debugging and monitoring of agent interactions
- Consistent output format across all agents

### 2. Robust Error Handling
- Proper handling of agent escalations
- Default fallback responses when agents fail
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

### 3. Improved Event Processing
- Correct iteration through ADK events
- Proper detection of final responses
- Support for different response types (content, escalations, etc.)

### 4. Production Ready
- Consistent execution pattern across all agents
- Better error reporting and logging
- Maintainable and debuggable code structure

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Execution
```python
# The new pattern is automatically used by all agents
agent = GoalPlanningAgent()
result = agent.run("I want to learn Python programming")

# Output will show:
# >>> User Query: I want to learn Python programming
# <<< Agent Response: [Generated goal structure]
```

### Multi-Turn Conversations
```python
# Session continuity is maintained
response1 = await adk_config.execute_agent_async(
    agent=agent,
    user_input="I want to improve my fitness",
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="fitness_session"
)

response2 = await adk_config.execute_agent_async(
    agent=agent,
    user_input="What exercises should I focus on?",
    user_id="user123", 
    session_id="fitness_session"  # Same session for context
)
```

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify the new pattern:

```bash
# Test all agents
cd python-agents
python test_updated_agents.py

# Run demonstration
python demo_new_pattern.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All agents now use the same execution pattern
2. **Debugging**: Clear visibility into agent queries and responses
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized execution logic in `adk_config.py`
5. **Production Ready**: Robust pattern suitable for production deployment

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated agents with real API keys and environment setup
2. Monitor agent performance and response quality
3. Add additional error handling as needed based on production usage
4. Consider adding metrics and monitoring for agent execution times
