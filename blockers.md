# Project Blockers

## High Priority Blockers

### 1. Critical ADK Architecture Mismatch - Python/Java vs TypeScript
**File:** Multiple files across project  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The entire project architecture is designed around Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with TypeScript imports, but ADK is only available in Python and Java, not TypeScript/JavaScript. This creates a fundamental architectural mismatch that blocks all ADK-related functionality.

**Affected Files:**
- `.kiro/specs/ai-goal-planning/design.md` (lines 78, 148, 284, 434) - TypeScript ADK imports
- `src/App.tsx` - ADKGoalService and ADKCalendarService imports
- `src/services/GoalCalendarService.ts` - ADKCalendarService usage
- `src/services/SMARTGoalOrchestrationService.ts` - ADK integration service
- `src/__tests__/adk-integration.test.ts` - ADK integration tests
- Multiple other service files with ADK dependencies

**Root Cause:** ADK Usage.md now clarifies that ADK is Python/Java only, but the codebase assumes TypeScript/JavaScript availability.

**Suggested Action:** 
**Option 1 (Recommended):** Implement Python ADK backend service
- Create Python backend service using ADK agents
- Expose REST API endpoints for TypeScript frontend
- Update TypeScript services to call Python backend APIs
- Maintain existing React frontend architecture

**Option 2:** Replace ADK with TypeScript-compatible alternatives
- Replace ADK with LangChain.js or similar TypeScript agent framework
- Update all ADK references throughout codebase
- Revise architecture documentation

**Option 3:** Mock ADK interfaces for development
- Create TypeScript mock implementations of ADK interfaces
- Allow development to continue while architectural decision is made
- Plan migration to proper solution

**Updated:** 2025-01-31 (Escalated from High to Critical priority)

### 2. Python Virtual Environment Missing Dependencies
**File:** python-agents/.venv/  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The Python virtual environment exists but is missing required dependencies including `google-adk`, `flask`, and other packages listed in requirements.txt. This prevents the Python ADK backend service from starting, which blocks all AI-enhanced features.

**Root Cause:** Dependencies are installed globally but not in the virtual environment that the project is configured to use.

**Error Message:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google_adk'`

**Suggested Action:**
- Activate the Python virtual environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Windows CMD)
- Install dependencies in virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify installation: `python -c "import google_adk; print('Success')"`
- Update development documentation with proper setup steps

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31
**Updated:** 2025-01-31 (README.md now provides clearer setup instructions)

### 2a. Missing API Key Configuration
**File:** python-agents/.env  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The Python ADK service requires API keys for AI models (Google AI Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic) but no .env file exists with actual configuration. The service will fail to start or function without proper API keys.

**Root Cause:** The .env.example file exists with placeholder values, but users need to create their own .env file with real API keys.

**Error Message:** API authentication failures when trying to use AI models

**Suggested Action:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Get Google AI Studio API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
3. Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here` in .env file
4. Optionally configure other AI provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic)
5. Never commit the .env file with real keys to version control

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

### 2b. Google ADK Package Availability Issue
**File:** python-agents/requirements.txt  
**Line:** 1  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The requirements.txt file specifies `google-adk>=1.8.0` but this package may not be publicly available on PyPI. Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) might be in private beta or require special access, which would prevent installation of dependencies.

**Root Cause:** The `google-adk` package referenced in requirements.txt may not be publicly available or may require special authentication/access.

**Error Message:** `ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement google-adk>=1.8.0`

**Suggested Action:**
1. Verify if Google ADK is publicly available on PyPI
2. Check if special access or authentication is required for ADK
3. Consider using alternative packages like `langchain` or `crewai` for agent functionality
4. Update requirements.txt with available packages
5. Modify agent implementations to use available frameworks

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

### 2c. ADK Runner Pattern Fixed ✅ RESOLVED
**Files:** Python agent files  
**Priority:** ~~Critical~~ **RESOLVED**  
**Description:** ~~The SMARTCriteriaAgent was using incorrect ADK runner pattern by calling `self.adk_agent.run()` directly instead of using the proper `Runner` pattern with session management.~~ **FIXED**

**Affected Files:**
- ~~`python-agents/agents/smart_criteria_agent.py` - was using direct `self.adk_agent.run()` calls~~ **FIXED**

**Root Cause:** ~~The agent was calling the ADK agent directly instead of using the proper runner pattern with session management.~~ **RESOLVED**

**Resolution Applied:**
✅ **FIXED**: Updated SMARTCriteriaAgent to use correct ADK runner pattern:
- Replaced `self.adk_agent.run(criteria_prompt)` with `self.adk_config.execute_agent_sync()`
- Updated both `run()` and `generate_milestone_suggestions()` methods
- Now uses proper session management with user_id and session_id
- Follows the same pattern as other agents (GoalPlanningAgent, GoalAnalysisAgent)

✅ **VERIFIED**: All agents now use correct ADK patterns:
- `python-agents/agents/goal_planning_agent.py` - uses proper `adk_config.execute_agent_sync()`
- `python-agents/agents/goal_analysis_agent.py` - uses proper `adk_config.execute_agent_sync()`
- `python-agents/agents/smart_criteria_agent.py` - **NOW FIXED** to use proper `adk_config.execute_agent_sync()`
- `python-agents/adk_config.py` - implements correct `Agent`, `Runner`, `SessionService` pattern

✅ **TESTED**: Created and ran test script confirming the fix works correctly

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31
**Date Resolved:** 2025-01-31

### 2d. ADK Import Testing Indicates Installation Issues ⚠️ HIGH
**File:** User settings (external)  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Recent user settings change shows addition of a command to test Google ADK imports: `"python -c \"from google.adk import session_services; print('Import successful')\""`. This suggests the user is experiencing import failures when trying to use the ADK package, confirming the dependency installation issues.

**Root Cause:** The Google ADK package is either not installed in the virtual environment or not available publicly, causing import failures when trying to run the Python agents.

**Error Symptoms:** 
- Import failures when trying to use ADK classes
- Need to manually test ADK imports via command line
- Python agents cannot start due to missing dependencies

**Suggested Action:**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Test if Google ADK is actually available: `python -c "from google.adk import session_services; print('Import successful')"`
2. If import fails, verify ADK package availability on PyPI
3. Consider using alternative agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) if ADK is not publicly available
4. Update requirements.txt with available packages
5. Modify agent implementations to use available frameworks

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

### 3. SQLite Database Implementation Missing
**File:** src/database/index.ts  
**Line:** 46  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** The database factory throws an error when SQLite is requested, indicating it's not implemented yet. This blocks production deployment scenarios.

**Error Message:** `SQLite database not yet implemented. Using in-memory database.`

**Suggested Action:**
- Implement SQLite database adapter in `src/database/SQLiteDatabase.ts`
- Add proper database migration and schema management
- Update database factory to handle SQLite initialization

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Incomplete Service Implementations
**Files:** Multiple ADK service files  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Several ADK-based services are imported and used throughout the application but may have incomplete implementations due to missing ADK framework.

**Affected Services:**
- `ADKGoalService.ts`
- `ADKCalendarService.ts` 
- `SMARTGoalOrchestrationService.ts`

**Suggested Action:**
- Review service implementations after ADK dependency is resolved
- Ensure all service methods are properly implemented
- Add comprehensive error handling for ADK failures

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

### 5. Missing AI Model Integration
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** The specifications mention support for multiple AI models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) but there's no actual integration with these services.

**Suggested Action:**
- Implement actual AI model integrations or mock services
- Add API key configuration for external AI services
- Create fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

## Medium Priority Issues

### 6. TypeScript Compilation Error in ADKGoalPlanningService ✅ RESOLVED
**File:** src/services/ADKGoalPlanningService.ts  
**Lines:** 275, 305  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** ~~The recently edited ADKGoalPlanningService.ts file has TypeScript compilation errors due to using invalid LifeDomain values. The code uses `'personal'` which is not a valid value in the LifeDomain enum.~~ **RESOLVED:** Added `PERSONAL = 'personal'` to LifeDomain enum.

**Error Message:** ~~`Type '"personal"' is not assignable to type 'LifeDomain'`~~ **FIXED**

**Root Cause:** ~~The fallback goal creation methods use hardcoded `'personal'` string instead of a valid LifeDomain enum value.~~ **RESOLVED:** LifeDomain enum now includes PERSONAL value.

**Resolution Applied:**
1. ✅ Added `PERSONAL = 'personal'` to LifeDomain enum in `src/types/index.ts`
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation now passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` returns exit code 0
3. ✅ ADKGoalPlanningService.ts can now use `LifeDomain.PERSONAL` without errors

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31  
**Date Resolved:** 2025-01-31

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. TypeScript Compilation Warnings
**Files:** Multiple files  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Several TypeScript hints about unused variables and parameters that should be cleaned up for code quality.

**Examples:**
- Unused imports in various files
- Unused parameters in function signatures
- Variables declared but never read

**Suggested Action:**
- Clean up unused imports and variables
- Add underscore prefix to intentionally unused parameters
- Enable stricter TypeScript linting rules

**Date Identified:** 2025-01-31

## Notes

- Tests are currently passing (97/97), indicating the mock implementations are working for development
- The application can run in development mode with fallback implementations
- Production deployment is blocked until ADK dependency and database issues are resolved
- **Task 5 Status Change**: Task 5 "Install and Configure Google Agent Development Kit" was recently changed from completed `[x]` to partial `[-]` status, indicating that while ADK agents are implemented, they cannot run due to the critical blockers listed above
- **Positive Progress**: ADKGoalPlanningService.ts was recently refactored to properly connect to Python Flask API instead of trying to use ADK directly in TypeScript, which addresses the architectural mismatch. However, a minor TypeScript compilation error was introduced that needs fixing.
