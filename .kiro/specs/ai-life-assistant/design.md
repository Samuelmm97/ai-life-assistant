# Design Document

## Overview

The AI Life Assistant is designed as a modular, AI-driven platform that orchestrates multiple life management domains through intelligent agents. The system follows a domain-driven architecture where each life area (fitness, nutrition, finance, etc.) is managed by specialized agents that can collaborate and share context. The core innovation lies in the SMART goal engine that serves as the central orchestrator, ensuring all domain plans align with user objectives and integrate seamlessly with existing schedules.

The platform uses a microservices architecture with a central coordination layer, allowing for independent scaling and development of different life domains while maintaining tight integration through shared data models and event-driven communication.

### Service Architecture Patterns

**Domain Agent Pattern**: Each life domain is managed by a specialized AI agent that understands domain-specific requirements, constraints, and optimization strategies. Agents communicate through a shared event bus and can request services from other agents.

**Event-Driven Coordination**: Changes in one domain trigger events that other relevant domains can respond to. For example, a new fitness goal triggers events that the nutrition agent uses to adjust meal plans and the scheduler uses to block workout times.

**Intelligent Scheduling Layer**: A centralized scheduler that understands priorities, energy patterns, dependencies, and constraints across all domains to optimize time allocation.

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Orchestration Service

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate between domain agents
- Manage cross-domain dependencies and conflicts
- Handle user authentication and authorization
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Maintain system-wide state consistency

**Key Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface CoreOrchestrator {
  createGoal(goal: SMARTGoal): Promise<GoalPlan>
  updateGoal(goalId: string, updates: Partial<SMARTGoal>): Promise<GoalPlan>
  resolveConflicts(conflicts: DomainConflict[]): Promise<Resolution[]>
  getUnifiedDashboard(userId: string): Promise<Dashboard>
}
```

### SMART Goal Engine

**Responsibilities:**
- Guide users through SMART goal creation
- Generate action plans and milestones
- Coordinate with domain agents for implementation
- Track goal progress and suggest adjustments

**Key Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface SMARTGoalEngine {
  validateGoal(goal: GoalInput): ValidationResult
  generateActionPlan(goal: SMARTGoal): Promise<ActionPlan>
  trackProgress(goalId: string): Promise<ProgressReport>
  suggestAdjustments(goalId: string, progress: ProgressData): Promise<Adjustment[]>
}
```

### Domain Agent Services

Each domain agent follows a common interface pattern while implementing domain-specific logic:

```typescript
interface DomainAgent {
  createPlan(goal: DomainGoal, context: UserContext): Promise<DomainPlan>
  updatePlan(planId: string, changes: PlanChange[]): Promise<DomainPlan>
  getScheduleRequirements(planId: string): Promise<ScheduleRequirement[]>
  handleExternalEvent(event: DomainEvent): Promise<void>
  getProgressMetrics(planId: string): Promise<ProgressMetrics>
}
```

**Fitness Agent:**
- Creates workout routines based on goals, fitness level, and available equipment
- Integrates with health data and nutrition plans
- Adjusts intensity based on recovery metrics and schedule constraints

**Nutrition Agent:**
- Generates meal plans aligned with health, fitness, and budget goals
- Creates shopping lists and meal prep schedules
- Monitors nutritional intake and suggests adjustments

**Finance Agent:**
- Creates budgets and savings plans
- Tracks expenses and provides spending alerts
- Calculates costs for other domain plans and suggests optimizations

### Intelligent Scheduler

**Responsibilities:**
- Import and sync external calendars
- Optimize time allocation across all life domains
- Resolve scheduling conflicts intelligently
- Adapt to user behavior patterns and preferences

**Key Features:**
- Energy-based scheduling (high-energy tasks during peak hours)
- Dependency-aware scheduling (prerequisites before dependent tasks)
- Conflict resolution with priority-based suggestions
- Adaptive rescheduling based on completion patterns

### Analytics Engine

**Responsibilities:**
- Track progress across all life domains
- Identify patterns and correlations in user behavior
- Generate insights and optimization suggestions
- Provide predictive analytics for goal achievement

**Key Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface AnalyticsEngine {
  generateInsights(userId: string, timeframe: TimeRange): Promise<Insight[]>
  predictGoalSuccess(goalId: string): Promise<SuccessPrediction>
  identifyBottlenecks(userId: string): Promise<Bottleneck[]>
  suggestOptimizations(userId: string): Promise<Optimization[]>
}
```

## Data Models
