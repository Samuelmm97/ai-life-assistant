## Notes

**Current Architecture Gap**: The biggest gap is the missing ADK framework integration. The current implementation uses traditional TypeScript services, but the requirements specify using Google's Agent Development Kit for AI agent orchestration. Phase 2 tasks focus on this critical migration.

**Immediate Next Steps**: 
1. Install ADK framework and dependencies
2. Migrate existing services to ADK agent architecture
3. Implement agent orchestration patterns
4. Test agent coordination and communication

**Technical Debt**: The current implementation is solid but needs architectural changes to meet the ADK requirements. The migration should preserve existing functionality while adding agent capabilities.
