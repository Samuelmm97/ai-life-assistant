# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Life Assistant is a comprehensive personal development platform that helps users achieve their life goals through intelligent planning, organization, and tracking. The system leverages Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to orchestrate specialized AI agents that create personalized plans across multiple life domains, with a core focus on SMART goal methodology. Using ADK's flexible multi-agent architecture, the assistant coordinates various specialized agents for different life management domains including calendar scheduling, meal planning, fitness routines, health monitoring, sleep optimization, financial planning, learning paths, habit tracking, and more to provide holistic life optimization support. The ADK framework enables model-agnostic agent development with flexible orchestration patterns (Sequential, Parallel, Loop) and rich tool ecosystem integration. The system can import existing schedules and commitments to ensure all new plans work seamlessly with the user's current lifestyle.
