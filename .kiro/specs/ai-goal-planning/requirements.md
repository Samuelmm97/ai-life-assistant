# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create comprehensive goal plans through natural language input. Instead of manually filling out detailed forms with SMART criteria, timelines, and action steps, users simply describe their goal in conversational language, and the AI automatically generates a complete, structured plan with all necessary components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to describe my goal in natural language, so that I can quickly create a comprehensive plan without having to think through all the detailed planning components myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language goal description THEN the system SHALL parse the description to extract goal intent, context, and implicit requirements
2. WHEN the system processes the natural language input THEN it SHALL automatically generate SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) based on the description
3. WHEN the AI generates the plan THEN it SHALL include realistic timelines, milestones, and action steps derived from the user's description
4. IF the natural language description lacks specific details THEN the system SHALL make reasonable assumptions and fill in gaps with sensible defaults
5. WHEN the plan is generated THEN the system SHALL present it to the user for review and approval before saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand context and nuance in my goal descriptions, so that the generated plan is relevant and personalized to my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user mentions timeframes (e.g., "by summer", "in 6 months") THEN the system SHALL convert these to specific dates and deadlines
2. WHEN a user describes activities or outcomes THEN the system SHALL infer appropriate metrics and success criteria
3. WHEN a user mentions constraints or preferences THEN the system SHALL incorporate these into the planning logic
4. WHEN the system detects ambiguous language THEN it SHALL make contextually appropriate interpretations
5. WHEN generating action steps THEN the system SHALL sequence them logically based on dependencies and optimal progression

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to refine the AI-generated plan through conversational feedback, so that I can adjust the plan without starting over or manually editing complex forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI presents a generated plan THEN the user SHALL be able to provide feedback in natural language
2. WHEN a user requests changes (e.g., "make it more aggressive", "add more detail to the first month") THEN the system SHALL update the plan accordingly
3. WHEN the user approves the plan THEN the system SHALL save it as a structured goal with all components properly formatted
4. WHEN the user wants to modify specific aspects THEN they SHALL be able to do so through conversational commands rather than form editing
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all related plan components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to leverage best practices in goal setting and planning, so that my generated plans are effective and increase my likelihood of success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating timelines THEN the system SHALL apply realistic time estimates based on goal complexity and type
2. WHEN creating action steps THEN the system SHALL break down large goals into manageable, sequential tasks
3. WHEN setting milestones THEN the system SHALL create meaningful checkpoints that enable progress tracking
4. WHEN the plan involves skill development THEN the system SHALL include appropriate learning phases and practice periods
5. WHEN the goal type is recognized (fitness, career, learning, etc.) THEN the system SHALL apply domain-specific best practices and common success patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with specialized AI agents for natural language processing and goal generation, so that I get intelligent, context-aware planning assistance through a robust multi-agent architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes natural language input THEN it SHALL use ADK-based specialized agents to extract intent, context, and requirements
2. WHEN generating SMART criteria THEN the system SHALL use multiple ADK agents working in parallel to create specific, measurable, and relevant goal components
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize the ADK orchestrator agent with default models and be ready for use
4. WHEN an AI agent or model is unavailable or fails THEN the system SHALL use ADK's built-in error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback about agent execution status and progress

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to select and switch between different AI models within the ADK framework, so that I can choose the model that works best for my planning needs and preferences while maintaining the benefits of the multi-agent architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the goal planning interface THEN I SHALL see the currently selected AI model for each specialized agent
2. WHEN I want to change models THEN I SHALL be able to select from ADK-supported models (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
3. WHEN I select a different model THEN the ADK agents SHALL reconfigure to use that model for subsequent operations
4. WHEN I switch models THEN my current planning session SHALL continue seamlessly with the new model through ADK's model abstraction
5. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL persist my choice and apply it to all relevant agents
6. WHEN viewing available models THEN I SHALL see ADK-provided information about each model's capabilities, performance, and compatibility with different agents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to leverage ADK's built-in capabilities for agent orchestration, evaluation, and deployment, so that the goal planning system is robust, scalable, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are processing goals THEN the system SHALL use ADK's sequential and parallel orchestration for optimal performance
2. WHEN the system processes complex goals THEN it SHALL leverage ADK's multi-agent coordination and delegation capabilities
3. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN the system SHALL use ADK's built-in evaluation framework to assess performance
4. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL use ADK's containerization and deployment features for scalability
5. WHEN agents interact with external services THEN they SHALL use ADK's rich tool ecosystem and custom function integration
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL leverage ADK's safety and security patterns for reliable operation
